# Back To The 90's
Back To The 90's is a site that exudes early '90's middle school/ high school kids web development. It has some basic tools and features that the user can play around with like the date and time button, the dancing unicorn mini-game, and the cute-kitten image hover- among others. 

Even from the first moment the user opens this site, the feeling of early 90's permeates the screen.

## General Information
- Back To The 90's is a site for those who wish to take a moment to travel back to simpler times, when the revolution of modern developing was only a dream and many high school kids spent hours building their own "place" online.
- This site is intended to create a nostaglia for the user- a remembrance of simpler times. It is also for entertainment, simplistic interactions, game-play, and fun.

## Setup
To setup this project go to my GitHub repository at: https://github.com/tbraeck/phase-1-final-project

Start with the README file and then open the CSS, HTML, and Javascript files in a text editor like VS Code.

The only remaining file associated with the project is the db.json which contains the array used for the iteration method.


## Usage
Below are snippets of some code within the project.

//JavaScript example for date and time button//

`document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", displayDate);

function displayDate() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
    console.log('You now know the date and time! You are welcome!');
}` //// the buton click event for fetching the date and time

//HTML example for the gif dance floor associated with the dancing unicorn mini-game//

`<!-- dance floor gif 
<!-- <div>
    <div id="dfloor"> <img
            src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/1r8VkS9JMQaIYNHWDu/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47f19c6w0l1onfn0mghertcw1bxbxspq1x9k0ji1ad&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g"
            alt="dance floor dancing GIF">FIND THE DANCE FLOOR
    </div>
</div> --> `


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ I feel like there is always room for improvement. I know once I have imprved as a developer I can come back and make this even better than it is already.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- I need to improve the aesthetics of the overall site 
- Improve the use interface/ experience

To do:
- Work on the styling/ placement of elements
- Add or subtract other features, interactions, experiences
